# Forest-Fire-Prediction
Data Science and Machine Learning techniques for predictive modeling.

## Description
This repository demonstrates a pipeline to predict the size of forest fires based on environmental and weather factors. Using the Forest Fires dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the project employs data preprocessing, feature engineering, and a Random Forest Regression model to achieve predictions.

Key features:

1. Data preprocessing: Categorical encoding and log transformation.

2. Model training: Random Forest Regressor.

3. Performance metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ².

4. Visualizations: Feature importance and actual vs predicted comparisons.
